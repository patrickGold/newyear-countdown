# newyear-countdown

Web app that counts down to next January 1st. It selects automatically the next year (based on local system time). Background images are made with svg inline tags.

See a preview: https://patrickgold.github.io/newyear-countdown/

## Known bugs
a) It is not possible to get local Date() on iOS devices. Will be fixed soon.
